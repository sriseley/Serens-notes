# Cat hate pseudoscience

I started with the 2023 fact sheet "The impact of roaming pet cats on Australian wildlife". https://invasives.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pet-cat-impacts-June-2023.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com

The first source is a Conversation article "One cat, one year, 110 native animals: lock up your pet, it's a killing machine" https://theconversation.com/one-cat-one-year-110-native-animals-lock-up-your-pet-its-a-killing-machine-138412

This Conversation article refers to the author's new analysis, a 2020 review by Legge et al. This review makes the following claim: 

"Introduced cats have had profound impacts on native faunas in many places, contributing to 26% of the total extinctions of mammals, birds and reptiles globally since 1600" 

and cites Doherty et al (2016). But all Doherty et al (2016) did is download a dataset from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (the 2014 Red List) and essentially tally the invasive species that are implicated as threats by this database. 



The 2023 fact sheet cites the figure that each roaming and hunting pet cat in Australia kills 186 animals per year. This is a figure from Legge et al (2020). Legge et al estimated predation rates of pet cats in Australia as follows:
- searched the literature for studies on: pet cat population, percentage of pet cats that roam (have access to the outdoors), the proportion of roaming pet cats that hunt, and predation rates of roaming, hunting pet cats. 
- six studies of Australian pet cats produce a figure that 71.1% roam outside
- 10 studies suggest that 78.4% of roaming cats bring prey back to their owner's house
- population of pet cats is by census (3.77 million)
- combining roaming + hunting data: 3.77 million -> 2.10 million
- 12 Australian studies showed that Australian pet cats bring home 28.1 prey items per cat per year
- seven non-Australian studies compared predation rates between prey return rate and scat study or cat-borne video, suggesting 15.1% of killed prey were brought home
- they then scale the "prey return" rate of 28.1 prey items per cat per year up to 186 prey items per cat per year 
- 186×2.1×10^6 = 390 million

The 2023 fact sheet, in contrast, cites 546 million. 



Doherty et al (2016) cite Woinarski et al with the following claim:

"predation by feral cats and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) has led to the decline or extinction of two thirds of Australia’s digging mammal species over the past 200 y" (1)

But what Woinarski et al actually say about cats and foxes is this:

"the loss of Australian land mammals is most likely due primarily to predation by introduced species, particularly the feral cat, Felis catus, and European red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and changed fire regimes" - no evidence in support of this claim, just more secondary citations. For example: 

"Analysis of historical records has also demonstrated that when either of these two predator species (and, in some cases, the nonnative black rat, Rattus rattus) have established on islands, many of the native mammal populations have rapidly followed the mainland trajectory of decline and loss" (Woinarski et al 2015)

with two citations. One of them is Burbridge et al 2002, who used data of mammal extinctions on Australian islands to fit a logistic regression model to the probability of extinction given different variables. "Our major conclusions are that foxes and cats are correlated with native mammal extinctions, but that cats are associated with extinctions only on more arid islands"

I would say that Woinarski's claim about "rapidly" following the mainland is not supported by Burbridge et al's (2002) discussion of their own experiment. 

The other citation that Doherty uses for their claim (1) is Fleming et al (2014).
